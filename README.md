System Identification and Self-Tuning PID Control using NN and reinforcement learning

You can read the attached pdf file for learning algorithm and structures.

To see the results, you can run the .m file in matlab.

If you want to change the dynamic system, Please just change the function "NonLinDynamic" in .m file.
