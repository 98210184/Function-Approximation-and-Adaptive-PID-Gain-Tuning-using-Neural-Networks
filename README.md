System Identification and Self-Tuning PID Control using NN and reinforcement learning

Important Notes:
PID_FA_NN.m : 
    this file is Fucntion approximation using Neural Networks with Adaptive PID Gains
    You can read the attached "PID Neural Networks.pdf" file for learning algorithm and structures.

FA_A2C.m :
    Function Approximation using Actor-Critic Algorithm

If you want to change the dynamic system, Please just change the function "NonLinDynamic" in .m file.
